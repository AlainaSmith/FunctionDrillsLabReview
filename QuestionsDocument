Question: Why does the [i] make such a difference in the array?
I understand that the array is being logged as many times
as the lenght of the array.

for (let i = letters.length-1; i >= 0; i--){
  console.log(letters[i])
}

Again in problem 16 Functions FunctionDrillsLab


Problem 15:  FunctionDrillsLab

Why is the function being called like that?

const bigOrSmall = (arr) => {
  answers = []
  for (let i = 0; i < bigOrSmall.length; i++){
    if(arr[i] > 100){
      answers.push('big')
    } else {
      answers.push('small')
    }
  }
  return answers
}

let arrayEvaluator = bigOrSmall(bigOrSmallArray)

"Return the answers array inside of the function to a variable called
   `arrayEvaluator`"



Problem 21:
I am not sure where or how the comparison value comes into play 



I thought if you are apart of OUTER SCOPE, you can not reach the INNER SCOPE?

Questions on 22 about that.
